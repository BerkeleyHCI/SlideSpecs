INTRODUCTION

Data can help makerspace staff and leadership understand the
“pulse" of their space and inform strategic planning and deci-
sion making. Data can also be useful in crafting compelling
narratives to stakeholders and funders. Multiple prior papers
at ISAM have stressed the importance of collecting and ana-
lyzing data about makerspace usage. Prior work tends to fol-
low one of two primary methodological approaches. First, de-
scriptive statistics of automatically collected usage or sign—in
data may reveal a ﬁne—grained view of activity patterns. Sec-
ond, surveys completed by makerspace users can unravel the
motivations and reasons for makerspace use. In this paper, we
describe how to gain additional insights ﬁ'om automatically
collected makerspace data by applying aggregated time—series
analytics over multiple semesters.
